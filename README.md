<b>How to deploy this custom template onto any configured Story Map Journal:</b>
    
  1. Navigate to the story map you want to add the template to, and copy its AppID <br>
       <em>  *** the AppID is the 32-digit code at the end of the story map's URL ***</em>
  2. Go to your My Content page on Arcgis Online
  3. Click "Add Item" and then select "An Application". You should see this dialogue pop up:

  4. Make sure Type is set to "Web Mapping",  Purpose is set to "Ready To Use", and API is set to "JavaScript" 
  5. For URL, write in the following: <br>
        https://blueraster.github.io/UNICEF-Climate-Change/index.html?appid= <br> and then paste in the AppID you copied 
  6. Give your new map a title and tags and then press "Add Item"
    
Your story map should now appear in your ArcGIS Online account as a new item with the customized template deployed.

NOTE: You can still make changes to your story map, but <b>DO NOT try and edit the map using the new template.</b> You must go back to the original story map and edit using the normal configuration page. All changes you make will automatically update in the custom story map through refreshing the page.
